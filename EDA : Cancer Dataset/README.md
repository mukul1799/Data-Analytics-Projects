# Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analytics workflow applied to a large-scale, multi-country cancer dataset.
The project aims to extract statistically meaningful insights into cancer severity, survival outcomes, and treatment costs by integrating demographic, genetic, lifestyle, environmental, and clinical variables.

# Objectives

Perform robust Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand distributions, trends, and disparities

Quantify relationships between risk factors and cancer severity & survival

Identify key predictors influencing outcomes and costs

Analyze economic burden across demographics, countries, and cancer stages

Document insights with real-world healthcare relevance

# Dataset Description

The dataset contains 50,000 patient records with the following feature groups:

Demographics: Age, gender, country, year of diagnosis

Genetic & Lifestyle Risks: Genetic predisposition, smoking, alcohol use, obesity

Environmental Exposure: Air pollution

Clinical & Economic Variables: Cancer type, stage, treatment cost

Outcomes: Severity score, survival years

# Methods & Techniques

EDA: Univariate & multivariate analysis, correlation analysis, group-wise aggregation

Statistical Inference:

Linear regression for risk–severity relationships

Hypothesis testing to assess significance of predictors

Interaction analysis (e.g., genetic risk × lifestyle factors)

Predictive Analysis:

Feature importance estimation

Outcome modeling for severity and survival trends

Visualization: Seaborn & Matplotlib for interpretable, insight-driven plots

All analyses are designed to be reproducible, interpretable, and statistically grounded.


# Key Outcomes

Identification of high-impact risk factors driving cancer severity

Evidence of disparities across countries, age groups, and cancer stages

Quantified relationship between treatment cost, stage progression, and survival

Clear documentation of insights with healthcare and policy implications
